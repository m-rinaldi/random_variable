random_variable
===============

Random Variables in Ruby.

The random_variable gem allows you to use random variables as you would usually do in maths.

To date, the supported random distributions are:
- Bernoulli
- Beta
- Binomial
- Chi-Squared
- Continuous Uniform
- Discrete Uniform
- Exponential
- F
- Normal
- Pareto
- Poisson
- Rademacher
- Rayleigh

and more distributions are on the way.
